# REBBL-Monte-Carlo-Simulator

This is a simplistic Monte-Carlo simulation used to predict the chances of any given team in a division making it to the playoffs.

It takes two arguments: a .csv file in the format 'Team 1, Score 1, Score 2, Team 2' and an integer stating how many playoff spots the division has.

See REL5D and REL5E for examples.  Lines that do match the specified format are simply ignored.
